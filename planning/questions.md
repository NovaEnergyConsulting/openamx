# Planning Questions (Sprint 002)

## Assumptions Made (clearly marked per builder rules)

- **Expression placeholder for lets in Sprint 002**: The requirements state "capture identifier name and the raw expression text (or a minimal ExpressionNode placeholder)". Full expression parsing is explicitly out of scope (Sprint 003). 
  - Assumption: We will implement minimal scaffolding in `parseExpression.ts` supporting only atomic cases (number literals, string literals, boolean literals, simple identifiers). 
  - For any RHS that is not a simple atomic (e.g. contains operators like `a + b`), during Sprint 002 the splitter will produce an `IdentifierNode` whose `name` holds the raw RHS text as a placeholder. This satisfies the `expression: ExpressionNode` type contract on `VariableDeclarationNode` without implementing any operator/Pratt logic.
  - This placeholder approach will be replaced in Sprint 003; no tests in this sprint rely on complex expressions being correctly structured.
  - Recorded here so future sprints know this was temporary scaffolding.

- **Malformed let lines**: If a line starts with `let ` but does not match `let <valid-id> = <expr>`, the statement splitter will throw a descriptive Error (e.g. "Malformed let declaration..."). This fulfills "do not silently ignore". Full AMX error codes + diagnostics objects are out of scope for this sprint (only basic error handling for front matter is called out in acceptance). Tests for this sprint focus on happy paths + front matter errors.

- **SourceLocation granularity**: Per blueprint, "Column precision can be basic." We set `column: 1` for all nodes in this sprint. Line numbers are accurate.

- **parseDocument API**: It reads from disk (per requirements) so it is `async`. Lower level `parseFrontMatter(content: string)` and `parseStatements(body: string)` are pure and used directly by tests to avoid temp files for most cases.

- **Narrative whitespace**: Empty lines and paragraph structure inside narrative are preserved exactly (by collecting original lines). Only `let ...` lines are omitted.

- **Front matter edge cases**: We handle absent, empty `---\n---`, simple key/values. Complex YAML (anchors, tags) not required for v0.1. Malformed YAML throws Error with message (tests expect clear indication).

- **Identifier rules**: Strictly case-sensitive. Regex: starts with letter, followed by letter/digit/_ . Matches spec examples.

No other ambiguities found in the sprint artifacts. If new questions arise during implementation they will be appended here before proceeding.
